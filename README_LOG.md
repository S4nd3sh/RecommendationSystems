# RecommendationSystems
R Package for Recommendation Systems with Implicit Feedback.

The below goals were setup on July - 2017 but the development kept happening with out github.
All the progress can be found starting today 

###Goals:
1) Collaborative Recommendation Systems  
    a. User Based Collaborative Recommendation System  
    b. Item Based Collaborative Recommendation System  
2) Probabalistic Recommendation Systems  
    a. Markov Chain Recommendation System  
    b. Markov Decision Process Recommendation System  
3) Providing robust evaluation metrics
4) Providing Cross Validation support.
5) Packaging all the methods into one package and make it available for public.
6) Optimizing the code for better performance. Using RCpp to implement certain functions and logic where ever necessary to improve the performace of the code.
7) Future Steps - Add new recommendation systems.

Till today(17 - 12 - 2017) accomplished tasks stands as below.  
###Achieved:
1) Collaborative Recommendation Systems  
    a. User based Collaborative Recommendation System - Completed  
    b. Item based Collaborative Recommendation System - Completed  
2) Probabilistic Recommendation Systems  
    a. Markov Chain Recommendation System             - Completed  
3) Providing robust evaluation metrics                - Completed  
4) Providing Cross Validation support.                - Completed    
      
        
###Inprogress:  
5) Packaging all the methods into one package and make it available for public.  
6) Optimizing the code for better performance. Using RCpp to implement certain functions and logic where ever necessary to improve the performace of the code.
